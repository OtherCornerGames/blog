# Using Vue in Markdown

## Browser API Access Restrictions

Because VuePress applications are server-rendered in Node.js when generating static builds, any Vue usage must conform to the [universal code requirements](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/universal.html). In short, make sure to only access Browser / DOM APIs in `beforeMount` or `mounted` hooks.

If you are using or demoing components that are not SSR friendly (for example containing custom directives), you can wrap them inside the built-in `<ClientOnly>` component:

## Mo sub topics
With some stuff in them

## And even more

with a lot more stuff in this that is good

## elevator pitch
use star and stuff
